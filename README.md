## Installation

Installation by [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

Modify your composer.json by adding the following section (if it doesn't already exist):

```yaml
...
    "require": {
        ...
        "worldnewsgroup/marketo-api": "~0.1",
        ...
    },
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/bmenking-wng/marketo_api"
        }
    ],
...
```

Then run composer update:

```bash
$ composer update
```

## Usage/Quickstart

```php
use WorldNewsGroup\Marketo\Environment;
use WorldNewsGroup\Marketo\Model\Lead;

Environment::configure('client_id', 'client_secret', 'munchkin_id');

$result = Lead::getLeadById($leadId);

$lead = $result->leads();

echo "Hello, {$lead[0]->firstName}\n";

```

A request will return a Result object.  Depending on the call, response objects can be retrieved by
calling the appropriate object name, i.e., for the above the Result object $result->leads() will
return an array of any Lead objects generated by the requestion.
